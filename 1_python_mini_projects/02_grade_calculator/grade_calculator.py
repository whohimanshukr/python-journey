========================================================
This is the second project in my learning journey.
The Grade Calculator is a simple Python program that
allows users to input their marks and calculates the corresponding grade
based on predefined conditions.
The results are displayed using standard print statements.

This project was built after learning the concepts of
Control Flow (if-else) and Loops in Python.

Built with ðŸ’» by Himanshu Kumar.
