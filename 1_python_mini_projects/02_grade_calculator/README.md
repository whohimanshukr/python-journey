# 🎓 Grade Calculator – Mini Project #2

This is the second project in my **Python learning journey**.  
The **Grade Calculator** is a simple console-based program that lets users input their exam percentage and receive an appropriate grade based on standard logic.

It is written using **Python fundamentals** like:
- Control Flow (`if-elif-else`)
- Input/output with the user
- Proper variable naming and formatting
- No functions or loops — just linear, beginner-friendly flow

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Practice user input validation
- Implement real-world logic using conditional statements
- Output motivational feedback based on performance
- Follow clean code structure and formatting

---

## 🚀 Features

- 💯 Takes input percentage from the user  
- ✅ Validates if input is between 0–100  
- 🧾 Assigns a grade:
  - `A+` for ≥95%
  - `A` for ≥80%
  - `B` for ≥66%
  - `C` for ≥50%
  - `D` for ≥33%
  - `Fail` for <33%
- 🥇 Motivational and friendly feedback
- ❌ Handles invalid input gracefully (no crashes)
