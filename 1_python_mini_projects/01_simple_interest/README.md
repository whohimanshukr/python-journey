# 💰 Simple Interest Calculator

## 📚 What I Learned
This project demonstrates the **core fundamentals** of Python programming through a practical financial tool — a simple interest calculator.

### ✅ Concepts Covered
- **Variables**: Storing principal, rate, time, and calculated values
- **Type Casting**: Using `float()` to handle numeric input
- **Arithmetic Operators**: `*`, `/`, `+` for financial math
- **String Formatting**: f-strings with `.2f` precision
- **Basic Control Flow**: Simple `if` checks (optional)
- **User Input**: Gathering data via the `input()` function
- **Mathematical Formula**: SI = P × R × T / 100

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
1. Take user input using `input()`
2. Convert input into usable numbers with `float()`
3. Perform simple interest calculations
4. Format the results with proper currency symbols and decimals
5. Display the output clearly with labels

💰 Simple Interest Calculator
========================================
Enter Principal Amount (₹): 10000
Enter Rate of Interest (% per year): 8.5
Enter Time Period (years): 3

📊 Calculation Results:
------------------------------
Principal Amount: ₹10,000.00
Rate of Interest: 8.5% per year
Time Period: 3 years
Simple Interest: ₹2,550.00
Total Amount: ₹12,550.00

🔍 Additional Analysis:
-------------------------
Monthly Interest: ₹70.83
Interest as % of Principal: 25.50%

📈 Interest Comparison (Same Rate):
-----------------------------------
1 year(s): ₹850.00 interest, Total: ₹10,850.00
2 year(s): ₹1,700.00 interest, Total: ₹11,700.00
5 year(s): ₹4,250.00 interest, Total: ₹14,250.00
10 year(s): ₹8,500.00 interest, Total: ₹18,500.00
