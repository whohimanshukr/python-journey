# 🧵 Pattern Printer

A beginner-friendly Python console program that prints 15 different **text-based patterns** using basic `loops` and `conditional logic`. From simple rectangles to butterfly and diamond designs, this project helps you master nested loops, alignment, and creative output.

> 🚀 Built with only **fundamentals** — no functions, no exception handling — to reinforce raw logic and flow control.

## 🎮 Features

- Menu-driven interface with **numbered choices**
- Two levels of patterns:
  - Beginner (1–10)
  - Advanced (11–15)
- Takes dynamic `row` input for all patterns
- Supports custom `column` input for rectangular patterns

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the file.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python pattern_printer.py
````

4. Enter your pattern choice (1–15) and number of rows.
5. For rectangular patterns (1 & 2), you’ll be prompted for columns too.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

* `for` loops and nested loops
* `if-elif` conditionals
* Pattern logic & spacing control
* Clean and readable `print()` formatting

## 🏁 Status

✅ Completed and tested on console
🧱 Built without functions to emphasize logic
🧠 Suitable for beginners, school/college students

## 📌 Next Steps (Optional Ideas)

* Refactor using functions and dictionaries
* Add error handling for invalid inputs
* Add support for printing to a file
* Implement GUI using Tkinter (way later)
